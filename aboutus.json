But we still want to see a beautiful smile in our reflection in the mirror. Moreover, today, a person\u2019s success is determined by their appearance, and the state of their teeth is one of the important criteria.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be solved with the help of veneers, a type of fixed restoration. These are custom-made dental overlays (micro-prostheses) in the form of plates that correct defects in the tooth crown.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDental overlays have been used since the 1930s. Perfectly white dental plates were attached just as other dentures. Hollywood celebrities were the first to try them. Modern fixation technology was developed in 1982. Nowadays, it is one of the most popular and reliable methods in aesthetic dentistry and anti-age prosthetics.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIndications for Veneers\r\n\r\nVeneers are a sparing alternative to crowns. They are installed on the front of a depulped or living tooth, provided that a sufficient surface area is maintained. Only a small amount of tooth enamel is shaved for better contact with the plate. Usually veneers are 0.3 mm to 1.5 mm thick.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith modern dental microscopes we can work within the enamel, so the depth of preparation can be reduced to 0.2\u20130.7 mm. This makes it possible to preserve the enamel, to which the veneer is fixed with its tooth surface, and achieve the desired optical effect. The service life is extended to 10 years; it can be extended if one follows recommendations of the dentist, maintains good oral hygiene and has regular dental visits.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to change the colour of teeth by 1\u20132 or more tones.", "stages_of_treatment": "STAGES OF TREATMENT\r\n\r\n01\r\nASSESSMENT OF TEETH CONDITION:\r\nAssessment of teeth condition for signs of chipping, increased abrasion, carious foci, and composite fillings.  All this may affect the quality of plate fixation, optical characteristics, and the duration of use.\r\n\r\n \r\n02\r\nCOMPUTER MODELLING:\r\nComputer modelling of your smile with modern equipment and software \u2014 Digital Smile Design (DSD). Then the project is transferred to the Exocad or inLab software to create 3D reproductions (to print models).\r\n\r\nThen the patients are shown how their teeth will look after ceramic restoration. The doctor explains all the details of the process and the final result, which can be assessed and agreed upon before treatment. You can choose several options for prosthetics, adjust the shape, colour, size, and find the optimal solution.\r\n\r\n \r\n03\r\nTOOTH SHAVING OR PREPARATION:\r\nIf there is no caries, gum disease or old fillings to change, the dentist will shave the enamel of the front surface of the tooth and scan it. It will also be used to make a ceramic veneer with the help of special software.\r\n\r\n \r\n04\r\nINSTALLATION OF TEMPORARY PLASTIC VENEERS:\r\nThey protect the shaved teeth while the permanent veneers are manufactured.\r\n\r\n \r\n05\r\nFITTING OF PERMANENT VENEERS:\r\nAll the plates are attached and the accuracy of their fitting to the teeth is evaluated. If required, corrections are made.\r\n\r\n \r\n06\r\nGRINDING AND POLISHING:\r\nPreparation to the fixation to the teeth surface, installation of veneers, and grinding. They are fixed with special cement, which is matched by colour. This is the way to achieve the perfect match of veneers against teeth.\r\n\r\nIndications for veneer installation:\r\n\r\n- Visible discolouration of the teeth. This includes general darkening (yellowness or staining in a different colour, tetracycline teeth) or appearance of individual spots of different colours.\r\n- Dental Malformation and Malposition.\r\n- Wide interdental spaces.\r\n- Enamel defects, chips, cracks.\r\n- Disproportionately small teeth of the lower or upper jaw.\r\n- Multiple or discoloured fillings are among the consequences of tooth restoration.\r\n \r\n\r\nVeneers of diverse materials are installed in dental clinics in Kyiv. Ceramic veneers are the most durable.\r\n\r\nThey are manufactured to match the colour and translucency of natural teeth. Typically, 4 to 10 veneers are installed in the smile area, i.e., on the anterior and lateral teeth. Such prostheses have a service life of 10 years, they do not change their colour and retain their lustre, since ceramics resists colouring substances and protects the tooth.\r\n\r\nContraindications include malocclusion, anatomical peculiarities (e. g., low tooth crowns), bad habits, pathological abrasion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMethods for Manufacturing Ceramic Veneers\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDental laboratory technicians use various techniques to manufacture veneers:\r\n\r\nLayer-by-layer application \u2014 a thin foil is swaged around the gypsum model of the tooth, afterwards ceramic mass is layered on it and fired. According to a simplified technique, veneers are made on a refractory model.\r\n \r\n\r\nInjection moulding \u2014 first, wax plates are modelled, and then a veneer frame is formed from a softened ceramic block. Then the finished veneer is painted with the appropriate colour.\r\n \r\n\r\nMilling is the fastest and most accurate method for automatic manufacturing of all-ceramic structures (CAD/CAM). This is a fully computerised process preceded by scanning and modelling. The result is high-quality micro-prostheses with a minimum number of visits.\r\n \r\n\r\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\r\n\r\nThe advantages of ceramic veneers include:\r\n\r\n- An effective way to correct various defects.\r\n- Predictable result.\r\n- Minimum intervention (compared with crowns) within the enamel with the hard dental tissues and the nerve The gum is not damaged.\r\n- Greater wear resistance, colour stability, smooth surface with lower plaque build-up, which reduces the likelihood of tooth decay.\r\n- Rapid installation.\r\n \r\nA drawback of veneers is their relatively high cost.\r\n\r\nThorough diagnostics and planning, computer modelling, and manufacturing of all-ceramic products make it possible to combine the requirements for strength and high aesthetic results. With the development of state-of-the-art technology, veneers are increasingly affordable.", "features": "Thanks to a digital design we achieve the harmony of your smile with the distinctive features of your face.\r\nTest measurement allows you to see your smile prior to the start of treatment.\r\nHigh-quality ceramics ensure the transparency and natural tone and tincture of your teeth.\r\nIn order that the veneer does not cleave the doctor chooses the corner of its angle for precise contiguity with the adjacent teeth.

They are used as roots for individual crowns.\r\n\r\nA tooth is a complex structure that can be disturbed by various diseases. The most common of these are caries and its complications, periodontal diseases. Entire complexes of preventive and therapeutic measures have been developed to prevent such conditions, and doctors are doing their best to preserve patients' natural teeth, but sometimes the removal is inevitable. In this case, the installation of dental implants can be one of the ways to solve the problem of the lack of one or more teeth.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is important to restore the integrity of the dentition as soon as possible. And it's not just an aesthetic issue. Although the inability to smile broadly, the early appearance of wrinkles, the loss of the facial oval sharpness and the sunken cheeks also cause a lot of trouble, especially for women.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTooth loss can also disturb physiological processes, such as digestion, which 90 % of people do not think about. In the oral cavity, mechanical processing of food and the formation of bolus occurs, and this is an important first stage of digestion. In addition, adjacent teeth can be displaced and destroyed, and the jaw can be deformed. As a result, it will be much more difficult to install a dental implant.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIndications for implantation\r\nModern prosthetics based on implants is possible in almost all cases, regardless of the location or extent of a dentition defect.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDental implantation is indicated for:\r\n\r\n- the absence of one or more teeth,\r\n- bounded and free-end edentulous spaces,\r\n- complete absence of teeth.\r\n \r\n\r\nDental implants are especially necessary in cases, where there are no conditions for high-quality attachment of full or partial dentures, as well as intolerance to the materials of which removable prostheses are made.\r\n\r\nContraindications for implant placing\r\nLike other surgical interventions, dental implantation has a number of contraindications. They are divided into absolute and relative contraindications. The first ones include severe chronic diseases: tuberculosis, diseases of the skeletal system, in which the recovery of bones, nervous and cardiovascular systems with circulatory failure and oncological diseases are slowed down.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRelative contraindications include dental diseases, such as: stomatitis, periodontitis, malocclusion, diseases of the temporomandibular joint, bruxism, precancerous conditions of the oral mucosa, as well as thyroid pathology, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and others.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe installation of implants is also undesirable with poor oral hygiene, as this is a direct path to infection of the implant and surrounding tissues, and the development of peri-implantitis with subsequent rejection.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComplications of implantation\r\nComplications are divided according to the time of occurrence:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- during surgery: injury to adjacent mucous and bone structures, bleeding;\r\n- in the early stages: inflammation of the surrounding tissues, for the prevention of which anti-inflammatory and antibacterial agents are prescribed, oedema, pain, bleeding, discomfort;\r\n- in the long term after the end of prosthetics: complications associated with the fixation of the crown and its deformation, inflammation of the mucosa, the formation of pockets.\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecialists in the dental clinics of Kyiv and other cities of Ukraine monitor the development of dental implantology and take all measures to prevent complications, but much depends on the patient himself/herself.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTypes of implants\r\nImplants are distinguished by the material they are made of. It can be titanium, gold, zirconium, ceramics, glassy carbon and others. The most common of these is titanium. In shape, there are plate, screw, cylindrical, and tubular implants. Most of them have a porous coating, which contributes to its mechanical retention in the jaw bone and biocompatibility with it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nImplantation techniques are as follows:\r\n\r\n- one-stage implant placement: in this case, the implant is placed in the bone bed, its head protrudes into the oral cavity, and prosthetics begins immediately after the surgery;\r\n- two-stage implant placement: only the root part is placed in the bed, the mucous membrane is sutured above it, prosthetics begins 2-4-6 months (earlier on the lower jaw) after engraftment;\r\n- immediate implant placement: the implant is placed into the alveolar socket immediately after tooth extraction;\r\n- delayed implant placement is performed 2 or more months after tooth extraction, when the bone is completely rebuilt.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe cost of a dental implant is determined by many factors: the amount of bone tissue at the implant site and the need to perform additional procedures for its restoration or augmentation, the state of the gums, individual features, technology.\r\n\r\nThe price for dental implants is discussed with the doctor after initial dental examination, taking into account the number of teeth, which need to be restored.\r\n\r\nCare for implants is the same as for natural teeth. Careful oral hygiene is needed to prevent infection and inflammation. Professional cleaning is recommended once every 6 months.\r\n\r\nThe main thing is not to take too long with implantation, and your health and smile will be safe.", "stages_of_treatment": "01\r\nEXAMINATION:\r\nDuring a dental examination, the doctor assesses the condition of the oral cavity, dentition, mucous membrane, occlusion, conducts an x-ray examination, determines the possibility of implantation and its specific form.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in cases where the chronic diseases require monitoring, or the patient takes certain drugs, a number of examinations are conducted to evaluate the overall condition of the body. To do this, blood and urine tests, ECG, as well as a consultation with a therapist or a family doctor are performed.\r\n\r\n \r\n02\r\nVIRTUAL OPERATION:\r\nVirtual model surgery with assessment of the structure and thickness of a bone, as well as the possibility of installing an implant. Implants are selected individually for each patient, depending on the clinical situation and task.\r\n\r\n \r\n03\r\nPREPARATION FOR INSTALLATION:\r\nIf there is a lack of bone tissue, the previous bone augmentation is carried out.\r\n\r\n \r\n04\r\nINSTALLING IMPLANTS:\r\nA bed for the implant (its intraosseous part) is formed in the bone tissue; a healing screw is placed above.

Therefore, you should be scrupulous about the choice of devices.\r\n\r\nThe braces can be as follows:\r\nExternal and internal (vestibular and lingual)\r\n\r\nThey differ in the place of attachment. Classic braces are attached to the outer, facial surface of the teeth.\r\nLingual braces are attached to the lingual surface of the teeth. Such a novelty has immediately found enthusiasts who would like to hide the teeth alignment from the surroundings. However, invisible braces have limited indications for installation, a high price and a number of inconveniences associated with wearing them. For example, speech abnormalities and excessive salivation during the period of addiction.\r\n\r\nLigature and self-ligating\r\nThe difference between these devices is in the method of attaching the arc to the lock. For this purpose, special elastic ligatures are used.\r\nIn self-ligating braces (not to be confused with self-adjustable braces), the lock structure already contains an attachment. Thus, self-ligating devices have immediately become the best option to combine aesthetics and efficacy treatment.\r\n\r\nMaterial\r\n \r\nModern orthodontics offers a wide selection of materials of which locks are made. This allows to choose braces for any taste and budget. The braces can be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Metal braces are a time proved classic. Reliable and durable locks are inferior to aesthetics, but most patients can afford them.\r\n2. Ceramic braces are made of special ceramics, the colour of which is as close as possible to the colour of the teeth. Due to this, ceramic braces are almost invisible on the teeth.\r\n3. Sapphire braces are considered the most aesthetic ones. Clear artificial sapphire has only one drawback \u2014 fragility. In addition, sapphire braces are often more expensive than the ceramic ones.\r\n4. Plastic braces are a budget option for aesthetes. Their drawbacks are fragility and staining with food. Manufacturers are still working to improve their properties.\r\n5. Combined braces combine two materials: ceramics and metal. Ceramic locks are installed in the smile area, and metal locks \u2014 on the posterior teeth. Thus, a compromise between beauty and reliability is achieved.\r\n \r\nHow brackets are fixed\r\n\r\nBracket fixation raises a number of questions for future \u201cbraces wearers\u201d, like whether it hurts, how long the procedure is, what you can eat, how to brush your teeth, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fixation procedure on one jaw takes 1 to 1.5 hours, and is a painstaking process. The orthodontist should place the bracket on the tooth in a special position, only then the whole system will work correctly.\r\n\r\n\u201cEach bracket in the device is designed for a certain tooth. This is due to the anatomy of the teeth and their position in the jaw\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore installing, it is important to treat caries and its complications, and a hygienist should remove plaque.\r\n\r\nAFTER FIXATION\r\n\r\nIn the first minutes, there will be a tickling sensation in your mouth but it will disappear quickly. To prevent possible discomfort due to the fact that the lips rub against the locks, the doctor provides a special protective wax. This is a material which is safe for the body and used to simply patch especially scratching elements.\r\nIn the first two days after bracket fixation or replacing the arch or its activation, pain is possible but it will subside on its own.\r\nAt the beginning of treatment, it is recommended to minimize the load on the dentition; it is not advisable to bite and gnaw large, solid pieces of food. Avoid sticky and viscous foods.\r\nFull addiction to the braces and the new look takes place within one to two weeks.\r\nDaily attention should be paid to oral hygiene in the morning and evening. On the recommendation of the orthodontist, you can buy special care products \u2014 orthodontic brushes \u2014 for high-quality cleaning of the braces from plaque.\r\n \r\nPrices for braces\r\n\r\nBefore installing braces in Kyiv, it is important for patients to study all the features of the procedure and compare the cost of braces.

Yet, they are not suitable for everyone and cause certain inconvenience to patients. This prompted the development of new orthodontic technologies. The use of caps (aligners) became an alternative to fixed braces.", "stages_of_treatment": "01\r\nCONSULTATION AND DIAGNOSTICS:\r\nThe first step in any orthodontic treatment is examination, diagnosis, and debridement. Caries and gum diseases should be treated before mouth guard installation. Dental calculus is also removed.\r\n\r\n \r\n02:\r\nWORKING GYPSUM MODELS\r\nAn orthodontist evaluates the indications for splint making and makes a cast of the teeth. For this, working gypsum models or virtual 3D models are made.\r\n\r\n \r\n03\r\nAGREED OF A TREATMENT PLAN:\r\nThe casts, X-rays and photographs of the patient are used to analyse the situation and make up a treatment plan. The final result is visualised by means of computer processing and agreed with the patient.\r\n\r\n \r\n04\r\nPREPARATION OF A SERIES OF CAPS:\r\nTreatment is divided into intermediate results, the so-called computer set-ups, which are used to make an individual set of solid models with the help of 3D printing. They serve as the basis for manufacturing of a required number of aligners.\r\n\r\n \r\n05\r\nTEETH ALIGNMENT:\r\nIn the process of correction, the doctor monitors the degree of alterations, treatment stages, and correspondingly changes the splints.\r\n\r\nCaps are a removable structure used to move teeth gradually and consistently for their alignment. Their main purpose is to shape a bite that is as close to the physiological one as possible. This is important, since any disorder associated with the position of the upper and lower dentitions relative to each other can cause increased abrasion, reduce their useful life, lead to undesirable changes in the shape of the face, headaches, and other pathological phenomena.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCaps are custom-made from a special transparent material on the basis of casts, moulds, or scans of the patient\u2019s teeth. They are very thin, fit the dentitions snugly, bring less discomfort than braces, are easy to wear and take care of.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlignment caps are usually recommended for adolescents above 14 years of age, but sometimes such treatment can be prescribed earlier \u2014 at 12 years of age. They should be worn for 20\u201322 hours a day; changes can be visible in 1\u20132 months.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIndications for Caps Use:\r\n\r\nTremae (lack of contact between the lateral surfaces of the teeth) and diastemae (a gap of more than 1.5 mm between the anterior teeth). Patients may be not bothered by such defects, so they do not always seek help. However, these defects contribute to teeth loosening, uneven load, increased risk of caries, gum disease and further malocclusion, therefore they require correction. An HP makes the decision on the need for correction.\r\n \r\n\r\nVarious twists or turns of the anterior teeth. Most often, these are caused by the lack of space for proper positioning of the teeth. Mouth guards ensure that the teeth are relocated to the correct position.\r\n \r\n\r\nModerate intrusion of the anterior teeth. This concerns tooth immersion into the socket, which is also called a hammered dislocation. The condition can be caused by a fall or a blow into the incisal part of the tooth.\r\n \r\n\r\nMinor cross-bite. Pathology can be associated with both congenital and acquired causes, including caries, severe periodontitis, disordered teeth eruption. In this case, the lower and upper dentitions intersect. The manifestations include asymmetry of the face, constant biting of the mucosa, teeth abrasion.\r\n \r\n\r\nFurther treatment with braces. Manufacturers are constantly improving aligner systems, but severe malocclusion, tooth twists, movement or intrusion by more than 2 mm require more complex long-term treatment. Usually it begins with brace installation. In such cases caps are only used at the final stages.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere are certain contraindications for the use of caps. These include: severe diseases of the internal organs and nervous system, mental disorders, the acute stage of a periodontal disease and other diseases of the oral cavity, jaw maldevelopment, and non-erupted teeth.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAligners are used in the cases when braces are contraindicated, e. g., if a patient needs to move just 1 or 2 teeth or in excessive tooth mobility, when braces deliver too much pressure.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe modern technology for the manufacture of aligners involves digital modelling and high-precision computer software, which virtually eliminates possible errors. The treatment is controlled by an orthodontist who uses special software. You can see the result even before the correction begins by means of computer visualisation programmes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe cost of caps depends on the severity of disorders, the number of aligners per course, and the manufacturer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCaps Types\r\n\r\nAligners differ by the materials used, manufacturing methods, and some other characteristics. Caps for occlusion correction can be:\r\n\r\nThey are manufactured on the basis of a specific template and are ready for use. They are relatively cheap, but the result can be obtained only with minimum malocclusion. They are not used in professional dentistry.\r\nCustom-made. These are the most effective, made on the basis of casts or 3D models of the jaw for each patient individually. They are changed depending on the clinical situation every two weeks until the desired result is achieved.\r\n \r\nCaps Care\r\n\r\nPrior to caps installation, the patient receives all the care recommendations. It is sufficient to wash the aligners daily with running water and brush them with a toothbrush. The patient should control the temperature of the water, since the caps can be deformed subject to high temperatures. Even if the cap does not look dirty, it must be cleaned. Otherwise, microbes can accumulate on its surface, which increases the risk of dental caries and affects the aesthetic appearance of the caps.\r\n\r\nTeeth should be cleaned as usual, preferably after each meal. Flossing is also recommended. Enamel is not damaged or abrased by caps. Professional cleaning is provided once every 3\u20136 months.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDuration of Treatment\r\n\r\nEven minor movement of teeth is a very slow process, so treatment with orthodontic caps are a time-consuming process. The minimum duration is 4 to 6 months, for more complex disorders it may reach up to 2.5 years. To accelerate changes, one may resort to phased treatment, when at first braces are prescribed, followed by aligners.\r\n\r\nSometimes 1 or 2 months is enough to notice the first results subject to regular use.\r\n\r\n\r\nCost of Treatment\r\n\r\nThe cost of caps depends on the material and the required number of aligners.

It consists of ligaments, gums, tooth cement, periodontium and alveolaris processus. Its main role is to fix and hold the tooth in the bone hole. In addition, it provides blood supply due to a large number of blood and lymph vessels, contains many nerve receptors, allows to evenly distribute mastication load throughout the dentition and protects against infections.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPeriodontal diseases\r\nPeriodontists are involved in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of periodontal diseases, among which the most common inflammatory diseases are periodontitis, as well as dystrophic processes (parodontosis).\r\n\r\nThe development of chronic inflammation is accompanied by destruction of the alveolar tissues, which can lead to tooth loss. According to statistics, periodontitis is most often diagnosed in pregnant women and patients with diabetes mellitus.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe severity of periodontitis is determined by:\r\n\r\n- the depth of periodontal pocket,\r\n- the degree of bone loss,\r\n- tooth mobility.\r\n \r\n\r\nThere are several stages of the disease, and the consequences are not limited to the oral cavity. There may be disorders in the digestive system; immunity is reduced, cardiovascular diseases occur, and the psychoemotional sphere suffers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe main symptoms of periodontitis: bleeding, bad breath, increased tooth mobility, gum inflammation, its low level and lengthening of the cervical margin of tooth which entails aesthetic problems.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe main reason for the development of inflammatory processes is poor hygiene and the accumulation of pathogens on the subgingival surface of the tooth root. The breeding ground for them is food debris. During the bacterial breakdown which forms the biofilm, a large number of toxins are released, which triggers immune reactions and destroys periodontium. Therefore, the main tactics to prevent periodontitis and the first stage of therapy is professional hygiene. Treatment should be initiated as early as possible, and its main goal is to remove dental deposits, bacteria, pathogens from the surface and restore the gingival attachment.\r\n\r\n \r\nTreatment of periodontal diseases\r\nThe modern treatment of periodontitis and parodontosis at the initial stage involves the refusal of surgical intervention in favour of conservative methods to clean the gingival pockets using ultrasound and other equipment techniques.\r\n\r\nVector therapy is the most gentle method based on the effect of ultrasound and a special calcium hydroxyapatite suspension, which increases the efficacy of root cleaning, and the periodontal pocket is intensively treated and washed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVector tooth cleaning, as the first stage of treatment, allows to get rid of subgingival and supragingival dental deposits, cope with soft tissue inflammation and polish the root surface.\r\n\r\nOur clinic uses an advanced Vector system (Vector apparatus manufactured by D\u00fcrr Dental, Germany).\r\n\r\nVector Therapy Results\r\nTreatment of periodontal diseases with Vector allows to avoid even greater exposure of the cervical margin of a tooth and to reduce the depth of periodontal pockets due to the attachment of a gum.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPatients note:\r\n\r\n- reduced bleeding,\r\n- lack of bad smell,\r\n- a feeling of clean mouth.\r\n \r\n\r\nTo fix the effect and prevent exacerbations of periodontitis, it is necessary to regularly undergo an examination and repeat the supporting procedures.", "stages_of_treatment": "01\r\nREMOVAL OF PLAQUE AND TARTAR:\r\nInitially, the removal of light plaque and tartar with the help of Air-Flow and ultrasound is compulsory.\r\n\r\n \r\n02\r\nIDENTIFYING THE STAGE OF GINGIVAL INFLAMMATION:\r\nFor this during the cleaning process the hygienist measures the depth of the gingival pocket around each tooth.\r\n\r\n \r\n03\r\nDEEP CLEANING OF ROOTS:\r\nOur doctor inserts a special nozzle in between the gums and the roots of the teeth.
